# DRDO-INTERNSHIP-PROJECT
May 19 2025 to July 4 2025
• Developed a computer vision–based Intruder Detection System using PCA-SVD for feature extraction and KNN for classification.

• Implemented real-time ML workflows, optimizing inference time, preprocessing, and dimensionality reduction.

• Worked in a high-security R&D environment applying ML experimentation, testing, and model evaluation.
